      "message": "Hi,\n\nThis is my new commit for model definitions in xapp-framework-cpp. I don\u0027t use swagger anymore and rewrite these things first and will do with REST API after this. I used 2 libraries:\n- https://github.com/nlohmann/json\n- https://github.com/pboettch/json-schema-validator\n\nThey are modern c++ json libraries and has good performance and nice syntax(like Go). Please help me review this!\n\n*NOTE: about CI, I will update it within tomorrow.\n\nAnh Nguyen",
