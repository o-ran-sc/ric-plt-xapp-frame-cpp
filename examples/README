This directory contains a few simple examples which illustrate
the various ways that the xAPP-C++ framework (xfcpp) can be
used.

xapp_t1.cpp
	A receiver which demonstrates how callbacks can be
	declared and used to process specific messages.
	Also demonstrates the simplicity of setting up an
	xAPP which simply responds to received messages (a
	total of 4 instuctions in main()).

xapp_t2.cpp
	A sender application which demonstrates how the framework
	can be used for applications which are sending based
	and need to check for responses. This does not involve
	the use of callbacks or the frameworks "driver".
