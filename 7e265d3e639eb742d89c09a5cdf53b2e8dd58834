      "message": "Hi,\n\nI\u0027d like to abandon this commit because of some reasons:\n\n- Swagger is no longer support Cpp client/server generator and even with older version it was dropped because I don\u0027t see any maintain commit on it for a long time.\n- Swagger server code (use pistache framework) has some problems with generated code and it\u0027s really hard to fix, maintain and go longer with this.\n- Because of some requirements from Mannila and I also think it\u0027s better to go like Go framework.\n\nI\u0027ll upload my new commit for this part within today to review first. I separate it into 3 parts:\n\n- ClientModel\n- ClientAPI\n- ServerAPI\n\nClientModel part will be uploaded within today and the other will be delivered later. I hope that it will better than swagger version!\n\nNhat Anh\n",
