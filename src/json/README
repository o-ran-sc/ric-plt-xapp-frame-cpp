This directory contains the code to allow the framework to
provide a light-weight json parser. The parser, based on
a the third party Jasmn code (link below) parses a json
"blob" into a symbol table (rmr_symtab). The xcpp_json
class provides the API to then access the parsed data.


The jsmn package is included at the root as an submodule
and is used only at build time.
