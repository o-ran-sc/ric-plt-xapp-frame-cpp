This directory contains the source for the RMR messaging portion of the 
framework.  Specifially:

	message.*
		provides a message class from which the user can extract/set information
		(type, subscription ID, payload, etc.) and provides instance funcitons
		for sending and replying to the message. User programmes will interact
		directly with this.

	msg_component.*
		This is a small type def that allows some of the getter functions in message
		to return a smart pointer to memory which cannot directly be released (e.g
		the payload).   This allows the user programme to declare a variable of type
		Msg_component (which is really a smart pointer with a custom deleter) rather
		than having to understand the needed smart pointer construct for these things.

	messenger.*
		This class provides the direct "wrapper" on top of RMR. It supports 
		high level operations such as Listen and callback management.

	callback.*
		This provides the callback support to messenger (listen) functions.

	default_cb.*
		This module contains any default callback functions which are provided
		by the framework (e.g. health check processing).
