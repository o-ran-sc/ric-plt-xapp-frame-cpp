&h2(Callback Receiver)
This sample programme implements a simple message listener which
registers three callback functions to process two specific
message types and a default callback to handle unrecognised messages.

&space
When a message of type 1 is received, it will send two response messages
back to the sender.
Two messages are sent in order to illustrate that it is possible to
send multiple responses using the same received message.

&space
The programme illustrates how multiple listening threads can be
used, but the programme is &bold(not) thread safe; to keep
this example as simple as possible, the counters
are not locked when incremented.
