This directory is the root of documentation source.
Below this directory you might find:

	lib - Directory containing common macros for all
		documents that live here.

	user - User guide document


In this directory running the command 'make publish' will
build and push all documents to the RTD scraper directory.
Simple documents, such as the release notes, are sourced
directly at this level as they require only a single
bit of input.
