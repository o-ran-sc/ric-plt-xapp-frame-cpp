This directory contains documentation source which generates
some (if not all) of the documentation that is put into the
directory scraped for RTD.  One of the advantages of this
approach is that example code presented in the document is
pulled from the examples directory in the repo which avoids
a duplicate set of "code" in the document which is likely to
become out of date.

The documents in the scraped directory (<repo-root>/docs)
can be created with the command 'make publish' executed
in the source (src) directory.
